### Hello ! Welcome to my Github profile ! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucie, I am a native French speaker, living in Barcelona for the past 5 years.

I have mainly been part of operations & support teams, from finance to digital marketing passing by the tourism & the transport industry, in various countries as France, Poland, Latvia, United Kingdom and Spain.

6 Months ago, I decided to start writting code, and bring to life all my creatives ideas :)

## => I joined the Ironhack Part-time bootcamp, and started the adventure ! 


I am always looking for excellence and the most efficient way to work = >Smart work >Hard work, that's my motto !

- I am good at connecting & bringing people together, I have a geniune interest in providing support and cheering on the people I work with.

- I am inquisitive, I am curious and a good observer. I love asking questions, and gaining knowledge.

- I am imaginative, I like to think about life as a big mysterious puzzle, full of adventures, suprises, where all things are connected.

In a nutshell, I am a creative, tech enthusiast looking to push boundaries and explore new ideas!

If you share the same excitement, I am happy to connect and speak with you very soon !
